          <h2>Aļļaah does not change</h2>
          <p>
            Refutation of the claim that scriptural mentions of anger and similar
            attributes imply real change in Aļļaah, and clarification of the
            Ashʿarī understanding.

          <h3>The claim</h3>
          <p>
            Wahhābī said: We know from the Sunnah that Allāh will become so
            angry on the Day of Judgement, in a way He has never been this angry
            before, nor will have ever become this angry later. What is it all
            if not “change”?
          </p>

          <h3>Aļļaah does not change</h3>
          <p>
            “لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ” – “Absolutely nothing resembles Him.”
            (al-Shūrā 11)
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand scriptures in this Wahhābī way is to say that Aļļaah
            is influenced by creation, and that creation causes events of anger,
            etc. in Him. Aļļaah is not affected by what we do, or anything else
            in the creation. He does not need creation in any way, shape or
            form. Aļļaah was perfect before the world existed and did not gain
            any additional perfection by its existence, nor lose any perfection
            because of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ” – “Verily Aļļaah has
            absolutely no need for the worlds.” (Āl ʿImrān 97)
          </p>

          <p>
            Al-Haythamī narrated in <em>Majmaʿ az-Zawāʾid</em> that a Bedouin said in
            his duʿāʾ, among other things: “ولا تغيره الحوادث”
            – “(O the One that) is not changed by events.” After he finished,
            the Prophet ﷺ called him, gave him some gold, and asked: “Do you
            know why I gave you the gold?” He replied, “Because of family ties
            between us, O Messenger of Aļļaah?” The Prophet ﷺ said: “Family ties
            have rights attached to them, yes, but I gave you the gold for the
            beauty of your praise of Aļļaah.”
          </p>

          <h3>The meaning of “anger” when ascribed to Aļļaah</h3>
          <p>
            In <em>Mufradāt al-Qurʾān</em>, al-Rāghib al-Aṣfahānī said about
            <em>ghaḍab</em> (wrath/anger): “the excitement of the heart’s blood
            for wanting revenge,” then he said: “If ascribed to Aļļaah, then it
            means revenge, without other meanings.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In <em>Lisān al-ʿArab</em> Ibn Manẓūr narrates from Ibn ʿArafah:
            “Ghaḍab in creation is something that enters their hearts, some of it
            good, some of it bad… As for Aļļaah’s ghaḍab, this is His
            disapproval of those who disobey Him so that He punishes them.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Explaining Ṭā Hā 81, where “ghaḍabī” (My wrath) is mentioned, Ibn
            al-Jawzī says it means: “My punishment.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Even in English, “wrath” does not necessarily mean a change in the
            one ascribed with anger. One definition is “retributory punishment
            for an offense or a crime: divine chastisement.”
          </p>

          <h3>Explanation of the ḥadīth</h3>
          <p>
            The ḥadīth states: “إِنَّ رَبِّي قَدْ غَضِبَ الْيَوْمَ غَضَبًا لَمْ
            يَغْضَبْ قَبْلَهُ مِثْلَهُ وَلَنْ يَغْضَبَ بَعْدَهُ مِثْلَهُ” –
            “Indeed my Lord has become wrathful today with a wrath that He has
            never had the like of before, nor will He have the like of after.”
          </p>

          <p>
            al-Nawawī, in his commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, said that what is
            meant by Aļļaah’s wrath is what appears of His punishment of those
            who disobey Him and what they see of His painful torture, and the
            horrors that the people witness on that Day – things that have never
            occurred before and will never occur again. There is no doubt that
            this specific manifestation will not have happened before that day,
            and will not be repeated after. This is the meaning of “Allāh’s
            wrath” here, just as His riḍā (being pleased) is the appearance of
            His mercy and gentle treatment of those whom He wills good for. It is
            impossible that Aļļaah Himself changes in “being wrathful” or
            “being pleased.”
          </p>

          <h3>Statements of the Imams</h3>
          <p>
            Imām Abū Ḥanīfa said in <em>al-Fiqh al-Akbar</em>:
            “…change and alteration occur only in created beings.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal said:
            “والله تعالى لم يلحقه تغير ولا تبدل ولا يلحقه الحدود قبل خلق العرش ولا بعد خلق العرش”
            – “Aļļaah, exalted, is not reached by change or substitution, and He
            is not reached by limits before the creation of the ʿArsh nor after
            creating it.” In other words, Aļļaah is not in a place above the
            ʿArsh.
          </p>

          <h3>Why the scholars insisted that Allāh does not change</h3>
          <p>
            Change is, in reality, the beginning of a new state, and anything
            with a beginning needs to be brought into existence. Having been
            brought into existence is to have been created. To say that Aļļaah
            changes is to say that He has created attributes and is therefore
            partly created, like the Christians who claim Allāh has a son – part
            creator, part creation.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this reason no scripture may be understood to mean that Aļļaah
            changes. Any text that seems on the surface to imply change must be
            interpreted in a way that fits the foundation: Aļļaah does not
            resemble His creation. At the most basic level, this means that
            neither He nor His attributes have a beginning, because anything
            with a beginning is a creation.
          </p>

          <p>
            To say that Aļļaah changes is not only to liken Him to creation, but
            to claim He is partly created. This plainly contradicts “لَيْسَ
            كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ” – “Absolutely nothing resembles Him.” It also
            undermines the proof for Aļļaah’s existence, which is based on the
            premise that everything with a beginning needs a creator. If one
            says that Aļļaah Himself has beginnings, they are effectively saying
            either that something can exist without a creator, or that Aļļaah is
            not the true Creator, or that He partially created Himself – all of
            which are false and destructive to sound belief.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this reason, the people of Ahl al-Sunna firmly affirm: Aļļaah
            does not change, does not enter time, and is not affected by events.
            It is His creation that changes, comes into existence, and passes
            away according to His eternal, unchanging Will and Knowledge.
